This is a machine learning regression model that aims to predict the amount of premium paid by individuals based on gender, age,pre-existing health conditions and other input variables. 
I also created the correlation matrix to find the strength of the input features to understand which features to pay more attention to.
I used the decision tree alogarithim and further used the ensemble method of the random forest.
After i plotted the true values and actual values to see how the model performed. I used Grid search for cross validation and hyperparameter tuning to find optimum parameters where the model best performed.
